# PokemonGo Map

Live visualization of all pokemon with option to show gyms and Pokestops, filter pokemon in your area. This is being worked on in my spare time, features I will be adding;
* Draggable Start location (Done)
* Display Scanning area (Have a marker inplace)
* Address Search
* In browser filters
* In browser Login
* Driving directions between pokemon based on expiration time and transportation method
* Expand on the queueing system to allow multiple instanced connections
* Admin Client w/ Remote restart of server

Using this software is against the ToS and can get you banned. Use at your own risk.
